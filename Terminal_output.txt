[' \n1 \n \n                               POLYMERS  \n  \nPolymers are the high molecular weight compounds obtained by repeated union of simple molecules. \n(Monomers).  Ex: Starch, Polyvinyl chloride, Polyethylene, Nylon 6, 6 and etc.  \nThe word ‘ Polymer ’ is coined from two Greek words: poly means many and mer means unit or part. \nThe term polymer is defined as very large molecules having high molecular mass. These are also referred to as \nmacromolecules , which are formed by joining of repeating structural units on a large scale. The repeating \nstructural units are derived from some simple and reactive molecules known as monomers and are linked to \neach other by covalent bonds. This process of formation of polymers from  respective monomers is called \npolymeriza tion. The transformation of ethene to polythene and interaction of hexamethylene diamine and \nadipic acid leading to the formation of Nylon 6, 6 are examples of two different types of polymerisation \nreactions.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMonomers    \nMonomer is a simple repetitive unit which when joined together in large numbers which give rise to a \npolymer. These are the building blocks of Polymer  \n \nEx: Vinyl chloride, ethene, propylene etc.  \nThe number of repeating units (n) in the chain so formed is called the Degree of polymerization (DP=n). \nPolymers with ahigh degree of polymerization are called High polymers  and those with low degree of \npolymerization are called Oligopolymers  \nDegree of polemerization (DP).  \nDegree of polymerization is a number, which indicates the number  of repetitive units (monomers) \npresent in the polymer. By knowing the value of DP, the molecular weight of the polymer can be calculated.  \n \n[Molecular wt of the polymer] = DP x Molecular wt of each monomer. DP is represented as ‘n’.  \n \nEx: (CH2 – CH2) n  Poly thene   \nHere ‘n’ is the DP.  \n \ni) Calculate the molecular weight of the polythene polymer given DP is 100.  \n \nMolecular weight of the polythene = DP X Molecular weight of  Polethene   \n= 100 X 28 =2800.   Basic Concepts:   1.Functionality  \n ', ' \n2 \n The functionality of a monomer  is the number of sites it has for bonding to other monomers under the given \nconditions of the polymerization reaction. Thus, a bifunctional monomer, i.e.,  monomer  with  functionality  \ntwo,  can  link  to  two  other  molecules  under  suitable  co nditions.  \nA polyfunctional monomer is one that can react with more than two molecules under the conditions of the \npolymerization reactions.  \n  \nDefinition: The number of bonding sites (or) reactive sites or functional  groups present in the \nmolecule.  \n \nEx: The  double bond in vinyl monomers (CH2 = CHX) can be considered as a site for two free \nvalencies. When the double bond is broken, two single bonds become available for combination.   \nH2C=CHX → --- CH 2 – CHX ------  \nA). When the functionality of monomer is two b ifunctional linear (or) straight chain polymer   is formed.   \n        Ex: (a)vinyl monomers (b)adipic acid (c)hexamethylene diamine  \n         Example for polymer: HDPE (high density polythene)  \n-M-M-M-M-M-M-M- \nB). When the functionality of monomer is three (tri-functional), three -dimensional net work  polymer is  \n       formed.   Ex: phenol, glycerol  \n       Examples for polymers : Urea formaldehyde, phenol formaldehyde.  \n                      \n-M-M-M-M-M-M-M- \n-M-M-M-M-M-M-M- \n-M-M-M-M-M-M-M- \n \nC). when a trifunctional monomer is mixed in small amounts with a bifunctional    monomer, a  \n        branched chain polymer is formed.  \n         Ex: LDPE (LOW density polyethene)  \n \n                                                  -M-N-M-N-M-N-M-N- \n                                                        M          N  \n                                                        N          M \n                                                        M          N  \n                                                        N          M \n                                                        M          N  \n \n2. Nomenclature of Polymers  \n   Polymers are classified in to four types  \n   a) Homo Polymers   b) Hetero polymers c ) Homo chain Polymers   d) Hetero chain polymers  \n  a) Homo Polymers    : Polymers made up of with same type of monomers are called homo polymers  \n      eg: Poly ethylene, PVC  \n \n  b) Hetero polymers  :  Polymers made up of with different type of monomers are called hetero polymers  \n       eg: buna -s rubber  \n \n       Graft  copolymers:  If main chain consists of one momomer and branched chain consists of another  \n               monomers are called Graft copolymers  \n                                                  -M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M \n                                                             N           N  ']
